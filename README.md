This is compilation of Labs completed by LynxLine (http://lynxline.com/projects/labs-portintg-inferno-os-to-raspberry-pi/) into the source code repository.

We started a small and exciting project just for fun as “Porting Inferno OS to Raspberry Pi”. Of course we would like to run it there as native, not hosted. It was always declared that this OS is very simple for porting to new platforms, so let’s just research this and reach new distilled experiences of system programming. Also this OS is very small, simple and easy to tweak for research purposes.

We decided to organize it as some set of small labs with very detailed steps of what is done to reach results and make everything easy to reproduce.
